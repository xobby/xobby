Today I officially stepped away from AstralHost.

This wasn’t an easy decision, especially because it was one of the very few projects that truly worked and delivered real results. However, the hosting provider shut down six months ago, making it impossible to continue operating the project as it once did.

For clarity: I did not leave the organization due to internal issues or lack of commitment. AstralHost was a solid and successful project, and I’m genuinely proud of what was built.

(And yes, ChillSpot Inc. is simply a non-profit project even tho it works it just doesn't give me any money for the work i make.)

Thanks to everyone who supported and believed in the project along the way.

On my portfolio the Work i made for AstralHosting is still available.
